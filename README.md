# python_heatwave

This project creates a geospatial world map and on providing 2 locations(from and to) ,it shows the least distant path between these locations also shows a heat map .This heat map represents the changes in weather and also any variations in temperature.
**Use Case ** of this application is : ATC control can view this before any flight take off and avoid this path in case of any abnormal weather conditions.
This was implemented as part of my Undergrad project.
